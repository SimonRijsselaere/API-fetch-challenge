# API-fetch-challenge

## What, Why, When, How, Who.
Collaboration of Ollivier VDH and me making an app fetching beer data and displaing it.
We made this because it's part of our lessonplan.
We use fetch to get the data from the API and display it using a mapfunction on a literal template.

## Pending things to do
1. add sort function
2. add filter function
3. use await and async to fetch all beers in single page
